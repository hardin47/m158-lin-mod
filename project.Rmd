The goal of this data assignment is to understand the variables in your dataset and their con- nections with each other. Your task is to collect and describe a set of data of your choice and to perform some descriptive statistical analyses. The hardest part will be finding an appropriate dataset to use. Additionally, you will want to think carefully about the observational units (rows) in the dataset, they must be independent.
