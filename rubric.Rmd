  Assessment will be based on the presentation and the final report. Your group itself, your class peers, and your professor will all provide feedback on the success of the project.

# Evaluation Criteria

The following guidelines will be used to evaluate reports.^[Adapted from Christina Knudson, Department of Mathematics, University of St. Thomas, Stat 333]


### An A-range paper will:

* show careful, creative, and critical thinking about the topic, questions, and results.  
* include appropriate references.
* be clear, concise, well-organized, and engaging.
* describe and interpret all important findings in the context of the study.
* be understandable to someone who has finished Math 158 and received a B or better. 
* use all technical terms correctly and have informative, carefully-crafted plots that are well-annotated (all plots must have captions).
* show exemplary understanding of the statistical methods we have discussed. 
* be grammatically correct. 
* look professional with no superfluous R code.
* follow all instructions.

### A B-range paper will:

* usually display careful, creative, and critical thinking but might have a few lapses.  
* be described accurately by at least 2 of the following descriptors: clear, concise, well-organized, and engaging.
* be {\em mostly} understandable to someone who has finished Math 158 and received a B or better. 
* describe and interpret all important statistical findings in the context of the study.
* show a solid understanding of the statistical methods we have discussed. 
* have references that are possibly incomplete.
* have plots that are good but not great (e.g., axes could be better labeled).
* usually use technical terms correctly. 
* have grammar that is usually correct, with maybe only a couple errors. 
* have only a few typos.
* have very few lapses with respect to superfluous R code.
* follow all instructions.

### A C-range paper might have **some** of the following problems:
* the included plots are problematic (e.g., uninformative axis labels) or barely relevant.
* no display of  consistent careful and critical thinking.   
* no appropriate references.
* technical terms that are used incorrectly several times. 
* be described accurately by only 1 of the following descriptors: clear, concise, well-organized, and engaging.
* be mostly inaccessible to someone who has finished Math 158 and received a B or better. 
* no description/interpretation of important statistical findings in the context of the study.
* an incomplete understanding of the statistical methods discussed in class. 
* a paper in need of basic editing: it may contain several typos and/or grammatical errors.



An unsatisfactory paper (D or F) might be incomplete or might have many of the problems that affect the C-range papers.
